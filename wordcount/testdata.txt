This annotated image depicts the ground tracks of NASA's Perseverance rover (white) and Ingenuity Mars Helicopter (green) since arriving on Mars on February 18, 2021. The green dots represent the locations of the helicopter's airfields during the 11 flights it has made between April 19 and August 4. The lower yellow ellipse highlights the "Raised Ridges" geologic feature that Ingenuity reconnoitered during Flight 10. The upper yellow ellipse depicts the "South Séítah" region, which Ingenuity is scheduled to fly over during its 12th sortie.
